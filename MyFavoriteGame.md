# My favorite videogame

My favorite videogame is League of Legends. League of Legends is a MOBA developed by Riot games https://www.riotgames.com/en released on October 27th, 2009. The reason I like this game so much is because it allows me to intellectually challenge myself while connecting with my friends. With all the complexities and nuances that go into playing well there is always something that I can actively think about and improve upon
